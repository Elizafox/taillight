# pylint: disable=too-many-instance-attributes
class Signal:
    """A signal is an object that keeps a list of functions for calling later
    based on events they listen for.

    These functions are referred to as slots. Each slot in taillight has
    several attributes: a priority, a UID (a monotonically increasing number
    based on the number of slot objects that have existed), a function, and
    arguments to call the function with.

    This is essentially the signals and slots pattern, but with support for
    slot priorities and having a well-defined order that the slots are called
    in. In addition, execution of slots may be stopped by raising
    :py:class:`~taillight.signal.SignalStop`. Signals may also be paused by
    raising :py:class:`~taillight.signal.SignalDefer`, where the signal will
    resume calling where it left off (preserving the arguments last called
    with, if none are passed in).

    When the signal is in a deferred state, adding or deleting slots is not
    allowed, as this would lead to inconsistencies in how the new slots should
    be called and how the deleted slots should be handled. However, a simple
    call to :py:meth:`~taillight.signal.Signal.reset_defer` resets the
    signal's deferred state; however, the calls will not pick up where they
    left off, and will restart from the beginning.

    Only one listener may be deferred at a time.

    By default, the slots are ordered by lowest priority first (0, 1, 2...).
    This is in line with the Unix style of priorities, and is rather intuitive
    from the programming perspective. When ``prio_descend`` is set to
    ``False``, higher priority slots are run first.

    When two slots have the same priority, their UID (computed at the time the
    slot is created) is used. The ordering follows the behaviour as described
    above with priorities.

    No two slots within a Signal instance can share the same UID. Forcing two
    slots to share a UID will result in undefined behaviour.

    Slots should not be transferred to other signals; instead, create another
    slot separately.

    This class is thread-safe and all operations may be performed by multiple
    threads at once.

    Like blinker, two signals with the same name will have shared slots. Weak
    references are kept around to each signal internally, so you will need to
    keep a strong reference around to each signal (or use the class
    :py:class:`~taillight.signal.StrongSignal`).

    Due to the fact that all signals with the same name will share a slot,
    ``prio_descend`` cannot be changed once it has been decided for a slot,
    until all strong references to the signal are freed.

    However, unlike blinker, all references to functions in the slots are
    strong. The complexity of weak references to methods, and especially
    decorated functions, aren't considered worth it. This also allows for
    things such as slots using ``lambda``. If such functionality is required,
    it is easily implemented by using weakref proxies independently.

    :ivar slots:
        The slots associated with this signal.

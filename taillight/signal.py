class Signal:
    """A signal is an object that keeps a list of functions for calling later.

    These functions are referred to as slots. Each slot in taillight has
    several attributes: a priority, a UID (a monotonically increasing number
    based on the number of slot objects that have existed), a function, and
    arguments to call the function with.

    This is conceptually similar to the concept of signals and slots, but with
    greater emphasis on priorities and having a well-defined order that the
    slots are called with. In addition, execution of slots may be stopped by
    raising :py:class:`~taillight.signal.SignalStop`, and deferred by raising
    :py:class:`~taillight.signal.SignalDefer`, where the signal will resume
    calling where it left off.

    When the signal is in a deferred state, adding or deleting slots is not
    allowed, as this would lead to inconsistencies in how the new slots should
    be called and how the deleted slots should be handled. However, a simple
    call to :py:meth:`~taillight.signal.Signal.reset_defer` resets the
    signal.

    By default, the slots are ordered by lowest priority first (0, 1, 2...).
    This is in line with the Unix style of priorities, and is rather intuitive
    from the programming perspective. When ``prio_descend`` is set to
    ``False``, higher priority slots are run first.

    When two slots have the same priority, their UID (computed at the time the
    slot is created) is used. The ordering follows the behaviour as described
    above with priorities.

    No two slots within a Signal instance can share the same UID. Forcing two
    slots to share a UID will result in undefined behaviour.

    Slots should not be transferred to other signals; instead, create another
    slot separately.

    This class is thread-safe and all operations may be performed by multiple
    threads at once.

    Note unlike blinker, all references to functions in the slots are strong.
    This is to ease the lifecycle management of objects, and allow for things
    such as slots using ``lambda``. If such functionality is required, it is
    easily implemented by using weakref proxies independently.
